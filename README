# Sheltzer SMASH

This is a collection of the elements needed from Peter Andrews' [SMASH](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.201491.115), which requires elements from Peter Andrews' [MUMdex](https://github.com/rhagenson/mumdex) code.

All content under `peter/` belongs to Peter Andrews. Source code under `peter/` may have been modified by Ryan A. Hagenson for the purposes of the Sheltzer Lab.

## Dependencies

+ mumdex/smash
  - build-essential
  - libx11-dev
  - libgsl-dev
  - ghostscript
+ MISC
  - R
    + BiocManager
    + DNAcopy

## Alternatives

NYGC has prepared a [Docker image](gcr.io/nygc-public/smash:25e1f2f) of SMASH prior to any edits made by Ryan A. Hagenson for application in the Sheltzer Lab. This is the same baseline Ryan A. Hagenson began his edits from and should match the original content under `peter/`.
